# System Design Interview (SDI)

An educational repository implementing solutions from **"System Design Interview" by Alex Xu**.

## Purpose

Learn system design and distributed systems by building real implementations, not just diagrams. Code follows principles from **John Ousterhout's "A Philosophy of Software Design"**:
- Deep modules with simple interfaces
- Clarity over cleverness
- Minimize complexity through good abstractions

## Structure

```
c4/              # Chapter 4: Design a Rate Limiter
└── golang/      # Go implementation
```

Each chapter contains implementations in various languages. See individual chapter READMEs for details.

## Chapters

- [Chapter 4: Design a Rate Limiter](c4/README.md)

This is a learning project. Code quality and design clarity are prioritized over feature completeness.
