# System Design Interview (SDI)

An educational repository implementing solutions from **"System Design Interview" by Alex Xu**.

## Purpose

Learn system design and distributed systems by building real implementations, not just diagrams. Code follows principles from **John Ousterhout's "A Philosophy of Software Design"**:
- Deep modules with simple interfaces
- Clarity over cleverness
- Minimize complexity through good abstractions

## Structure

```
golang/          # Go implementations (WIP)
├── cmd/        # Application entry points
└── internal/   # Private packages
```

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.21+

```bash
cd golang
make build      # Build all binaries
```

This is a learning project. Code quality and design clarity are prioritized over feature completeness.
